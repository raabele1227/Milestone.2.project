<h1>Light Roast</h1>

<p>
  Light roast coffee beans are heated at a lower temperature reaching 385 to 410
  degrees and for a shorter period of time than medium and dark roast beans.
  <!--(The Coffee Bean &amp; Tea Leaf, 2022)-->

  The beans will "pop" or "crack" when they reach the desired temperature which
  indicates they are ready to be removed
  <!--(The Coffee Bean &amp; Tea Leaf, 2022)-->. Their outer shell will crack as
  the beans expand in the roaster
  <!--(The Coffee Bean &amp; Tea Leaf, 2022)-->. These beans will only crack
  once due to cooler internal temperatures than their dark-colored couterparts
  <!--(The Coffee Bean &amp; Tea Leaf, 2022)-->

  Light roast coffee beans are the highest in caffeine content, acidic, and
  having a toasted grain or grassy taste.

  coffee.
  <!--(Pavoni, 2021)-->
  The coffee beans have a light brown color due to being taken out of the
  roaster early in first crack.
  <!--(Pavoni, 2021)-->
  Because of its roasting process, it has a grassy and highly acidic taste when
  brewed.
